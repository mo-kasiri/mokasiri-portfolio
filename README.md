### Welcome to my portfolio!
<p>This app is part of my master's thesis ‚ÄúAnalysis of Body Gesture as a Nonverbal Communication in Metaverse.‚Äù
We aim to enhance the nonverbal communication experience within a virtual three-dimensional (Social VR) setting.
The application captures the user's hand movements using an RGB webcam and replicates them onto a 3D avatar. This technology will allow users to express
themselves more effectively through physical gestures and movements, thus creating a more immersive and engaging virtual
environment. It connects people online and lets them express hand gestures in social virtual reality without a head-mounted display.</p>

* Communicate anonymously
* Join social VR without any HMD (Head-mounted Display)
* Enhance your communication in social VR by showing hand gestures
* Connect to your friends in a private environment
